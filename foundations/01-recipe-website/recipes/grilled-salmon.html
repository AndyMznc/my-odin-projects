    <h2>Description</h2>
    <div>
      <p>
        Grilled salmon skin, known as samon no kawa no shio yaki in Japan, is an
        easy recipe that can be savoured as an appetiser or as a side dish with
        soup or salad. This preparation is featured in Chihiro Masui’s book,
        Poissons, un art du Japon (‘Fish: An Art of Japan’), which contains 30
        traditional recipes adapted to European ingredients by chef Masao
        Karasuyama.

      <p>
        In this book, journalist Chihiro Masui meets prominent names in Japanese
        fish cuisine, such as Hachiro Mizutani and Takeshi Ohira, a fugu
        specialist. They detail the three fundamental Japanese techniques for
        fish preparation: ikejime, or ‘humane death’; chinuki, the bleeding of
        the fish; and ‘fish resting.’
