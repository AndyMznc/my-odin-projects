    <h1>Recipe for English Breakfast with "Udon" by TheSocialFood</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <div>
      <p>
        The combination isn’t necessarily an obvious one, but it works. In this
        recipe from their book The Social Food: Home Cooking Inspired by the
        Flavours of the World, Shirley Garrier and Mathieu Zouhairi offer a
        breakfast that pairs the crispiness and indulgence of bacon and hash
        browns with the chewiness of Japanese udon noodles. The dish is served
        in a bowl of dashi broth, thus adding a dose of umami.
      </p>

      <p>
        It’s an ambitious concept, one that strays far from the codes of the
        "conventional" Japanese breakfast, in which dashi and udon are replaced
        by miso soup and rice. The final Japanese twist to the recipe is the
        inclusion of shiitake mushrooms that, along with spring onions, add a
        vegetable-based touch to this breakfast.

        The Social Food: Home Cooking Inspired by the Flavours of the World
        compiles 80 recipes that allow readers to travel around the world
        without leaving their kitchen. "The Social Food is about our taste for
        travelling and our fascination for the different culinary cultures, and
        now our experiences in the kitchen", the duo explain. Shirley Garrier
        and Mathieu Zouhairi draw inspiration from Japan in particular, with a
        number of the recipes coming from the country. The book contains street
        food staples and more traditional dishes, as well as recipes that fuse
        different cultures, like this breakfast.
